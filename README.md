### What I learned

Not much, since It was a fairly easy challenge. I did learn that the frontendmentor preview screenshot does not support
css nestiong, so I had to remove the nesting in the css file.

```css
/* Before */
.card {
    .card__image {
        ...
    }
}

/* After */
.card {
    ...
}

.card__image {
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

Fairly easy challenge, but I need to work on my CSS skills.
